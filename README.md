# Prime Numbers

A NodeJS application that accomplishes the following:

- Generates all the prime numbers between 1 to X where X is a command line argument to the application
  (To Run: node app.js 100)
- Prime numbers are stored in a local Redis instance
- Once the prime numbers are generated the application repeatedly asks the user for a lower and upper bounds (inclusive) on the prime numbers to return along with their sum and mean
